Registration is mandatory for everyone who wishes to attend. There is an additional option available during registration for those who wish to attend the conference dinner. The number of places is limited.

The prices are as follows:

* **Regular Registration** 110€.
* **Student Registration** 0€.
* **Conference Dinner** 99€.
* **Permanent Inria Employees** 0€ (one dinner ticket included).

Registration is *free for all students* (dinner not included). We ask students who register to indicate the institution with which they are affiliated and to provide us with an email associated with their institution.

Permanent Inria employees may register for free and attend the conference dinner for free. To do so, please email Vladimir Zamdzhiev `{first.last at inria dot fr}` who will send you a special registration code that you can use during registration.

If you have specific dietary requirements, please register for the dinner by Wednesday 12 July. The restaurant needs time to prepare, so we cannot guarantee that specific dietary requirements made after that date will be respected.

**We have restricted registrations for the time being, due to a large number of registrations and room size limitations.** If you would like to attend, please write an email to Vladimir Zamdzhiev `first.last@inria.fr` and Benoît Valiron `first.last@universite-paris-saclay.fr`.

Please contact the organisers if you have any questions.
