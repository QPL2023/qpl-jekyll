Unfortunately, registration is still not open. However, the company that will handle the registration processing has now given us a date: **Thursday 6 July.** We expect to finally open the registration by then. The administrative procedures for arranging this are taking longer than we anticipated and this is one of the reasons for the very late date for registration.

Registration is mandatory for everyone who wishes to attend. There is an additional option available during registration for those who wish to attend the conference dinner. The number of places is limited.

The prices are as follows:

* **Regular Registration** 110€.
* **Student Registration** 0€.
* **Conference Dinner** 99€.

Registration is *free for all students* (dinner not included). We ask students who register to indicate the institution with which they are affiliated and to provide us with an email associated with their institution.

Please contact the organisers if you have any questions.
