#   ## Quantum Physics and Logic 2023
---

The **20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2023)** will
take place from 17 July to 21 July 2023 at [Institut Henri
Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/en) in Paris, France.  Quantum Physics and Logic
is an annual conference that brings together academic and industry researchers
working on mathematical foundations of quantum computation, quantum physics,
and related areas. The main focus is on the use of algebraic and categorical
structures, formal languages, type systems, semantic methods, as well as other
mathematical and computer scientific techniques applicable to the study of
physical systems, physical processes, and their composition. Work applying
quantum-inspired techniques and structures to other fields (such as
linguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality) is also welcome.

### Important Dates

* Abstract submission deadline: ~~1 March~~ 12 March 2023
* Paper submission deadline: ~~7 March~~ 17 March 2023
* Notification: 1 May 2023
* Registration deadline: TBA
* Camera-ready deadline: 1 July 2023
* Conference: 17 July -- 21 July 2023

All deadlines are stated with respect to the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe).

### Submissions

Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:

* **Proceedings submission.** This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must
  provide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient
  detail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.
  Submissions of work in progress are encouraged, but must be more substantial
  than a research proposal. Proceedings submissions should be prepared using
  the [EPTCS style files](https://style.eptcs.org/).
* **Non-proceedings submission.** This consists of a 3 page summary, together with
  a link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or
  preprint is not publicly available (e.g., not open access), then it should be
  included in full after the summary.
* **Poster submission.** This consists of a 3 page abstract of partial results or
  work in progress.
* **Programming tool submission.** This consists of a 3 page description of a
  programming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source
  contributions.

Page limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the
discretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by
[EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/my/conference?conf=qpl2023).

There will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the
Program Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the
authors are students at the time of submission.

### Registration

Registration is not open yet (we are waiting for some things to finish), but we hope to be able to open it soon. Please check back soon.

### Presentations

Authors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited
to give a long or short talk, depending on the quality and maturity of the
submission. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present
their work at the poster session. Authors of accepted programming tool
submissions will be invited to live demo their tool to conference attendees, at
the same time as the poster session.

The (preliminary) conference program is available [here](/program).

### Conference Proceedings

Conference proceedings will be published in [Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)](https://about.eptcs.org/) after the
conference.

### Local Information

The conference will take place at [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/en) in Paris, France.
