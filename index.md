#   ## Quantum Physics and Logic 2023
---

The **20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2023)** will
take place from 17 July to 21 July 2023 at [Institut Henri
Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/en) in Paris, France.  Quantum Physics and Logic
is an annual conference that brings together academic and industry researchers
working on mathematical foundations of quantum computation, quantum physics,
and related areas. The main focus is on the use of algebraic and categorical
structures, formal languages, type systems, semantic methods, as well as other
mathematical and computer scientific techniques applicable to the study of
physical systems, physical processes, and their composition. Work applying
quantum-inspired techniques and structures to other fields (such as
linguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality) is also welcome.

### Important Dates

* Abstract submission deadline: ~~1 March~~ 12 March 2023
* Paper submission deadline: ~~7 March~~ 17 March 2023
* Notification: 1 May 2023
* Camera-ready deadline: 1 July 2023
* Conference: 17 July -- 21 July 2023

All deadlines are stated with respect to the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe).


### Submissions

Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:

* **Proceedings submission.** This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must
  provide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient
  detail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.
  Submissions of work in progress are encouraged, but must be more substantial
  than a research proposal. Proceedings submissions should be prepared using
  the [EPTCS style files](https://style.eptcs.org/).
* **Non-proceedings submission.** This consists of a 3 page summary, together with
  a link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or
  preprint is not publicly available (e.g., not open access), then it should be
  included in full after the summary.
* **Poster submission.** This consists of a 3 page abstract of partial results or
  work in progress.
* **Programming tool submission.** This consists of a 3 page description of a
  programming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source
  contributions.

Page limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the
discretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by
[EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/my/conference?conf=qpl2023).

There will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the
Program Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the
authors are students at the time of submission.

### Registration

Registration is now open. More information is available [here](/registration/).

### Presentations

Authors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited
to give a talk. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present
their work at the poster session. Authors of accepted programming tool
submissions will be invited to live demo their tool to conference attendees.

The conference program is available [here](/program).

### Conference Proceedings

Conference proceedings will be published in [Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)](https://about.eptcs.org/) after the
conference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of
accepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages
(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and
suggestions under the provisio that they do not introduce new results.

### Local Information

The conference will take place at [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/en) in Paris, France.

{% include map.html id="location" title="Conference Location" %}

Paris has a dense public transportation network: metro, bus, tram and RER (regional train). A single one-way ticket costs 2.10€. There also are [packs](https://www.ratp.fr/en/titres-et-tarifs/t-tickets) and [day passes](https://www.ratp.fr/en/visite-paris/english/preparing-your-trip-tickets-and-travel-passes-designed-you). Notice that RER outside Paris (e.g. from/to airports) has specific fares. See also [local travel advice from IHP](https://www.ihp.fr/en/how-come-ihp).

The two amphitheaters, Hermite and Darboux, are located on the ground floor.
Coffee breaks will be held in between the morning sessions, and in between the afternoon sessions, in the space next to the two amphitheaters.
Please do not eat or drink anything (except water) inside the amphitheaters.
An additional room on the ground floor is at our disposal.

We are also given access to the library on the first floor of the building. The only requirement is to simply fill in the registration list at the entrance of the library. The library is quite nice and it is worth checking out!

Eduroam is accessible on site.

Alternatively, you may use the "IHP-Guest" network, which can be accessed using the following procedure:
1. Select the "IHP-Guest" network.
2. In the pop-up window, click on the button "Receive your credentials on this portal".
3. Fill in the form, and click "Register".
4. You get your credentials *for the current day*.
5. Clicking "Back", you get to the registration portal, but the credentials should be filled in. Click on "Connect". You now have access to the internet.

The conference dinner will take place at "Les Belles Plantes" located at [47 Rue Cuvier](https://goo.gl/maps/QAZaN9ywTRRjjsXNA). It is a short walk (approximately 15 minutes) from the conference venue.
The dinner will be vegetarian with vegan options available upon request.

Lunches are *not* provided by the conference organisers. There are many restaurants and food options close to the conference venue.
